# VR4EducationGodot
This repository was made to keep the resources of my Masters Thesis. From this thesis, two development idea/purpose have been emerged. It is possible to access my thesis from: https://comserv.cs.ut.ee/ati_thesis/datasheet.php?id=75298&year=2022 

Those are as follows:
1. A web tool that unify basic requirements of a students day to day activities. For example, taking notes, working on assignments, sharing files with other students, collaborating and brain storming etc. All of this features needs to be made intuitive for the virtual reality headset users. For example, taking notes on PC is easy with a physical keyboard. But typing in VR is not very easy until now with a physical keyboard, so voice typing might be one good option along with text notes. Or may be voice note can be an option. Now comes another challange when we try to collaborate with voice notes...So, this is still active research opportunity to find out best possible way.
Similiarly, we have to findout good solution for other activities and add them in this web tool. 

2. 3D VR app, that have a browser integrated with it, feature to run 2D android application inside it..kind of overlay, physical keyboard overlay and passthrough like Immersed. And development of this application should be done with Godot to help the open-soource community and further development. This application should be minimalisitic and focus will be main concern of it. This application should utilize the processing power of Meta Quest 2 headset. 

I have named this two application as 1. Buddi - the utility tool and 2. Buddi - 3D immersive environment for focused education

Initially I had kept both application in this repository. However, I am moving both application to their own repository for easier management. 

New repository for Buddi - The utility tool: https://github.com/masudme09/Buddi
